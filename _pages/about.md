I am a Mechanical Design Engineer specializing in power transformer tank design for voltage class upto 765kV. With expertise in Creo Parametric and Creo Customization, I focus on automating design processes using Creo Toolkit, Pro/PROGRAM, and API integration. I have extensive experience in CAD modeling, assembly design, and parametric modeling.

Additionally, I have a strong background in structural simulations using ANSYS and Creo Simulate, enabling me to validate and optimize designs for real-world applications.

Passionate about innovation and problem-solving, I continuously seek ways to enhance product development cycles through automation and advanced engineering techniques.
